1. Slash (/) between alleles in diploid
2. Wild type in all caps, deletion lowercase
4. Strain background before genotype for strains not BY4742
	- might need all strains to have background (can't programatically distinguish background name from genes)
  - might want to have separate strain background column


examples: 

diploid heterozygous null for SIR2
sir2/SIR2

diploid homozygous null double deletion
sir2/sir2 fob1/fob1

diploid heterozygous double null
sir2/SIR2 fob1/FOB1

with plasmids
sir2/sir2 fob1/fob1 + pDB868

over expression (all caps, -OE at end)
SIR2-OE

sequence modifications -name
SIR2-GFP
SIR2-TAP
